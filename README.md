# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## OVERVIEW

Roza, a microbiologist, has a theory that the bacteria found in belly buttons can be used to make synthetic beef.  She has partnered with Improbable Beef to collect samples from volunteers to determine which bacterial samples synthesizes to taste like beef.  Roza created a dashboard for volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterias found in their belly buttons, so when Improbable Beef identifies a species that can be used to make synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify the bacteria was found in their belly button.
